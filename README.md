# About

This repository contains the required files to showcase **Pytifex**. 
This repository includes the Pytifex source code, generated outputs, and the full environment configuration used to produce the results.

## Experimental Setup

I conducted all experiments on a workstation running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS, equipped with a 13th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1355U (12 cores) and 16 GB RAM. Our implementation uses Python 3.12.9. The code examples were evaluated using the following versions: `mypy 1.19.0 (compiled: yes)`, `pyrefly 0.44.2`, `zuban 0.3.0`, and `ty 0.0.1-alpha.32`.
